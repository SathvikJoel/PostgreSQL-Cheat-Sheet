# PostgreSQL-Cheat-Sheet
Cheat Sheet for PostgreSQL, notes taken from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw--VYLpxG4&t=4204s)


A database is a collection of data organized in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate the data.

> POSTGRE is the Database
> 
> SQL is the Structured Query Language ( Programming Lanuage)

### How data is stored

* Stores data in tables

* Columns 

* Rows

### Relational Database 

  * A database that has relationships between tables

### Getting Things Started

  * The postgresql package will by default create a user called postgres
  
  * Switch to the postgres user by `sudo -iu postgres`
> sudo -iu <username> logs you in as <username>, without having to know <username>'s password.

  * [Look at the Initial cofiguration section to create a database cluster](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PostgreSQL)
  * exit out of the postgres user by `exit`
  * start the postgresql.service using `systemctl start postgresql`
  * type `psql`
  * type `\q` to exit

* psql â€” PostgreSQL interactive terminal

* [Look at the Familiarize with PostgreSQL section to understand how to access database shell](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PostgreSQL)


### Next Time
| Command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `systemctl start postgresql` | Start the Service |
| `sudo -iu postgres` | Change to the postgres user |
| `psql -d databasename` | Start the database shell |
| `\q` | Exit the database shell |


### Commands


| Command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `help` | Gives a small help guide |
| `\?` | Gives a big help guide |
| `\l` | Lists all databases |
| `CREATE DATABASE testname;` | Create a database by the name of testname |
| `\c databasename` | change to database | 
| `\d` | (Describe) Show all the tables in Database |
| `\d tablename` | (Describe) Describe the table |
| `\dt` | Show only the table types (not other types) |
| `DROP TABLE tablename` | Drops the table |
| `DROP DATABASE dbname` | Drops the whole Database |
| `\i path_to_sqlfile` | Executes commands from a file |
| `SELECT col1, col2 FROM table` | select col1, col2 from table |
| `SELECT DISTINCT col FROM table` | select disctinct values from col only |
| `SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY col ASC` | Sort by col (ascending, default) |
| `SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY col DESC` | Sort by col (descending) |
| `SELECT * from table WHERE cond1 and cond2` | Filter based on multiple conditions |
| `WHERE col IN ('China', 'Poland', 'Japan')` | Filter if col is in the list |
| `WHERE col BETWEEN DATE '2000-01-01' AND '2015-01-01'` | Filter if col is between the dates | 




### Connec to a Database

`psql --help` gives a list of options

* Method 1 : 
`psql -h hostname -p port -U username` is a sample method to connect to a database, add other options accordingly

* Method 2 : 
go to psql and type `\c databaseaname` to connect to a database, the same command can be used to change the database

### A very Dangerous Command


To delete a database,

```sql
DROP DATABASE test;
```

> MAKE SURE YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT! 


### Create Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name(
  Column name + data type + constraints if any
);
```

Ex:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
  id int ,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  gender VARCHAR(6),
  date_of_birth TIMESTAMP,
);
```

#### All Data Types in SQL

[DOCUMENTAION : List of All the datatypes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype.html)

### Create Table with Constraints

Specify extra information that must be followed for every entry that is being addded

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
  id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY ,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  gender VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
  date_of_birth TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
);
```
### Insert records into tables

```sql
INSERT INTO tablename(
  col_name
)
VALUES ('value')
```


```sql
INSERT INTO person (
  first_name,
  last_name,
  gender,
  date_of_birth)
VALUES('Anne', 'Smith', 'FEMALE', DATE `1998-01-09');
```

Order in VALUES must match as given before

### Generate 1000 Rows with Mockaroo

[mockaroo website to create fake data](https://www.mockaroo.com/)

> person.sql is the file generate using mockaroo.com

You can directly add the table from the sql file using the following command

`\i path_to_loc\person.sql`

### Select From

`SELECT * FROM table` -- select all the columns from table

`SELECT col_name FROM table` -- select col_name from table

`SELECT col1, col2 FROM table` -- select col1, col2 from table

### Order By

`SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY col ASC` -- Sort by col (ascending, default)

`SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY col DESC` -- Sort by col (descending)

#### Multiple Columns

`SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY col1, col2 ASC` -- Sort by col1 then by col2 (ascending, default)

### Distinct

`SELECT DISTINCT col FROM table` 

Distinct removes duplicate values from the table

### Where Clause and AND

Filter based on condition

`SELECT * from table WHERE cond1 and cond2`

Eg:

`SELECT * FROM table WHERE gender = 'FEMALE';`

`SELECT * FROM table WHERE gender = 'FEMALE' and country_of_birth = 'Poland'`

### Comparision Operators

* `<>` is `not equals` symbol

### Limit, Offset & Fetch

`SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10` -- Limit the results by 10 records

`SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 LIMIT 5` -- Limit the results by 5 records and skip the first 5 records

> LIMIT is not an official SQL command, use FETCH instead

`SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY` 

### IN Keyword

Insstead of this

`SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth = 'China' OR country_of_birth = 'Poland' OR country_of_birth = 'Japan'`

Use `IN` keyword

`SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth IN ('China', 'Poland', 'Japan')`

### Between Keyword

`SELECT * FROM person WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN DATE '2000-01-01' AND '2015-01-01'`

### Like and iLike Operators

`SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%.com'`

'%' is a wildcard character, it matches any number of characters

`SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '--------.com'`

Number of `- ` is the number of characters to be matched

`ILIKE` is case insensitive

### Group By

`SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth`

Groups by and gives the count

### Group By and Having Keyword

Extra layer of filtering

`SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth HAVING COUNT(*) >5`

[List of Aggregate Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/functions-aggregate.html)

### Avg, Min & Max Functions

> Add a car table with the sql file given


`SELECT MAX(price) FROM car` -- Get the max car price

`SELECT AVG(price) FROM car` -- Get the average car price

`SELECT ROUND(AVG(price)) FROM car` -- Rounds the value

`SELECT make, model, MIN(price) FROM car GROUP BY make, model` -- Get the min price for each make and model

`SELECT make, model, MIN(price), MAX(price), AVG(price) FROM car GROUP BY make, model`


### Sum Function

`SELECT SUM(price) FROM car` -- Get the sum of all car prices

`SELECT make, SUM(price) FROM car GROUP BY make` -- Get the sum of all car prices from each make

### Basics of Arthemetic Operators

`SELECT 10 + 2;`

`SELECT 10 * 2;`

`SELECT 10 / 2;`

`SELECT 10 ^ 2;`

`SELECT 5!;`

`SELECT 10 % 2;`

### Arthemetic Operators - Round

`SELECT id, make, model, price, price * .10 FROM car;` A new column for the price and 10% of the price

`SELECT id, make, model, price, ROUND(price * .10, 2) FROM car;` See the usage of `ROUND`

### Alias

`SELECT id, make, model, price AS original_price, ROUND(price * .10, 2) AS discounted_price FROM car;` See the usage of `AS`

### Coalesce

`SELECT COALESCE(1);`

`SELECT COALESCE(null, 1);` Still gives 1

`SELECT COALESCE(null, 1, 10);` Still gives 1 ( first non null value )

`SELECT COALESCE(email, 'email not found') from person;`
